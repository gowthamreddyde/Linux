### Linux

This project is created to upskill in Linux and for future reference.

** Used AWS EC2 - CentOs machines to work with Linux.

Make sure our security group has access to port number **22.**

Once you create the server, you need to use the ssh command to log in to the server.

```
ssh -i <path-to-pem-file> username@IP-Adress
```

$ - denotes normal user <br/>
\# - denotes root user

**NOTE: Delete EC2 after practice**
